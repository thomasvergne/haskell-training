# Haskell training
You will find on this repository all my trainings on the Haskell programming language.
Here are the main categories in chronological order:
- [Simple Pythagore formula](src/Pythagore.hs) *11/11/2020*
- [Complex implementation](src/Complex.hs) *03/02/2020*
- [Optional implementation](src/Complex.hs) *03/03/2020*
- [Quaternion implementation](src/Quaternion.hs) *03/09/2020*

### Why did I decide to learn Haskell
So I decided to learn the Haskell for possible future research study needs. 
I am also passionate about how it works as well as mathematical logic, which Haskell integrates with excellence. 
Syntax is also one of Haskell's strengths: because the entire syntax is editable, it makes the code experience even more rewarding and interesting.
