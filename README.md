### Why did I decide to learn Haskell
So I decided to learn the Haskell for possible future research study needs. 
I am also passionate about how it works as well as mathematical logic, which Haskell integrates with excellence. 
Syntax is also one of Haskell's strengths: because the entire syntax is editable, it makes the code experience even more rewarding and interesting.
